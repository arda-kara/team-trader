## Architecture

The Risk Management module is designed as a layered system:

1. **Risk Models**: Quantitative models for risk assessment
2. **Risk Controls**: Rules and limits for risk management
3. **Portfolio Optimizer**: Algorithms for optimal capital allocation
4. **Exposure Manager**: Tools for monitoring and managing exposures
5. **Risk API**: Interface for other components to access risk services
6. **Risk Database**: Storage for risk parameters and historical data

## Integration Points
