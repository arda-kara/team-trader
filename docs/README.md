# AI-Augmented Full-Stack Algorithmic Trading Pipeline

## Overview (Project under development under QuantLab repository, TBA)

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the AI-Augmented Full-Stack Algorithmic Trading Pipeline. The system combines traditional algorithmic trading approaches with advanced AI capabilities, including semantic analysis and agentic intelligence, to create a powerful and flexible trading platform.

## System Architecture

The trading pipeline is designed with a modular architecture consisting of seven primary components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects and normalizes market data, news, and economic indicators
2. **Semantic Signal Generator**: Analyzes textual data to extract trading signals
3. **Strategy Generator & Optimizer**: Creates and optimizes trading strategies
4. **Execution Engine**: Manages order execution and broker integration
5. **Risk Management System**: Controls risk exposure and portfolio allocation
6. **Agentic Oversight System**: Provides intelligent supervision and coordination
7. **Dashboard Interface**: Offers visualization and control capabilities

Each component is designed to operate independently while communicating through well-defined interfaces, allowing for individual optimization and scaling.
