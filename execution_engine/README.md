# Execution Engine

The Execution Engine is responsible for translating trading signals and strategies into actual market orders. It handles order management, execution, position tracking, and integration with trading APIs.

## Key Components

- **Order Management System (OMS)**: Manages the lifecycle of orders from creation to execution to settlement
- **Execution Algorithms**: Implements various execution strategies to minimize market impact and slippage
- **Position Tracking**: Maintains real-time tracking of all open positions and their performance
- **Trading API Integration**: Connects to brokers and exchanges for order execution
- **Transaction Cost Analysis**: Analyzes execution quality and trading costs

## Features

- Support for multiple order types (market, limit, stop, etc.)
- Smart order routing to optimize execution
- Real-time position and P&L tracking
- Execution algorithms (TWAP, VWAP, Implementation Shortfall)
- Integration with multiple brokers/exchanges
- Comprehensive logging and audit trail
- Simulation mode for testing

## Architecture

The Execution Engine is designed as a modular system with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Engine**: Central coordinator managing the execution workflow
2. **Order Manager**: Handles order lifecycle and state transitions
3. **Execution Algorithms**: Specialized algorithms for different execution strategies
4. **Position Manager**: Tracks and manages positions and exposure
5. **Broker Adapters**: Interfaces with various trading APIs
6. **Execution Database**: Stores order and execution history

## Integration Points

- Receives trading signals from the Strategy Generator
- Coordinates with Risk Management for pre-trade checks
- Reports execution results to the Dashboard
- Provides feedback to the Agentic Oversight system
