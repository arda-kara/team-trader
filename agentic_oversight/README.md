# Agentic Oversight System

The Agentic Oversight System is an intelligent supervisory layer that monitors, coordinates, and optimizes the entire trading pipeline using LLM-powered agents. It provides human-like reasoning, anomaly detection, strategy adjustment, and explainability for trading decisions.

## Key Components

- **Agent Coordinator**: Orchestrates multiple specialized agents and manages their interactions
- **Monitoring Agents**: Continuously monitor pipeline components and market conditions
- **Decision Agents**: Make high-level decisions about strategy selection and risk management
- **Explanation Agents**: Generate human-readable explanations for trading decisions
- **Learning Agents**: Improve system performance through continuous learning
- **Human Interface Agents**: Facilitate communication with human operators

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of all pipeline components
- Anomaly and edge case detection
- Intelligent strategy selection and adjustment
- Risk policy enforcement and override capabilities
- Natural language explanations for trading decisions
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Human-in-the-loop collaboration
- Audit trail of agent reasoning and decisions

## Architecture

The Agentic Oversight System is designed as a multi-agent system:

1. **Agent Framework**: Core infrastructure for agent creation, communication, and coordination
2. **Agent Types**: Specialized agents for different oversight functions
3. **Memory System**: Short-term and long-term memory for agents
4. **Reasoning Engine**: LLM-powered reasoning capabilities
5. **Coordination Protocols**: Rules for agent interaction and conflict resolution
6. **Human Interface**: Communication channels with human operators

## Integration Points

- Monitors data from the Data Ingestion Layer
- Analyzes signals from the Semantic Signal Generator
- Supervises strategy creation in the Strategy Generator
- Approves or modifies orders from the Execution Engine
- Enforces policies from the Risk Management system
